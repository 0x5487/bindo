# Bindo demo

It is just a day project which is based on angular, expressjs and node.js.  I was planning to use react, but I was afraid that I cloudn't learn it very well within few hours.  Therefore, I am using angular instead.  Actually,
there should be 4 sections.  However, I am guessing that is a ruting job.  so, I implemented two sections which are sales and inventory.  If you have any feedback or concerns, please let me know.

## How to run it

1. clone the repo
2. switch to the app directory
3. run `npm install`
2. run `node app.js`

## Framework or library

1. angular
2. typescript
3. angular-loading-bar ( better ux experience for calling slow restful service)
4. expressjs
5. cookie-session
6. node.js

## How to be better

I know the application is buggy.  However, I'd show you some concepts which can enhance it in the future.

1. JWT token for api call
2. react
3.
